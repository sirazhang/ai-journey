  // Sparky Dialogue
  sparkyIntro1: "Bzzzt... System recalibrating... Systems Online. Oh, thank goodness a human is here! I am Sparky, the island's energy manager.",
  sparkyIntro2: "We have been infiltrated! Do you see those workers wandering around? Many of them aren't real elves.",
  sparkyIntro3: "They are Generative AI Agents in disguise. They look like us, but they are flooding our grid with bad data.",
  sparkyIntro4: "Technically speaking, Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that uses machine learning to create new content—including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data—instead of just analyzing existing data.",
  sparkyIntro5: "Let me explain simply. Generative AI is like a super-fast student.",
  sparkyIntro6: "It has read every book and seen every picture in the world. When you ask it to draw, write, or sing, it doesn't 'think' like you do.",
  sparkyIntro7: "It just guesses what comes next based on patterns. It's like a very clever parrot mimicking humans!",
  sparkyIntro8: "Yes! Please! I need you to find these AI impostors and remove them from the system.",
  sparkyIntro9: "Good question. Even though they are smart, they have big weaknesses. Listen carefully.",
  sparkyIntro10: "First is Hallucinations (The 'Daydreaming').",
  sparkyIntro11: "Sometimes, they gets overconfident and makes things up! 🖐️ Six-fingered hands? 🐙 Octopuses running banks? If it sounds too weird to be true—it's probably an AI hallucination!",
  sparkyIntro12: "Perfect. Here is your mission:",
  sparkyIntro13: "Go talk to the workers on the islands. Ask them to show you their photos or writing.",
  sparkyIntro14: "If you spot mistakes or copies, mark them down. There are 9 spies hidden in total. Good luck, Agent!",
  sparkyIntro15: "Excellent! Your mission is now active. Good luck, Agent!",
