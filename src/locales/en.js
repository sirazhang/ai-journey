  // Sparky Dialogue
  sparkyIntro1: "Bzzzt... System recalibrating... Systems Online. Oh, thank goodness a human is here! I am Sparky, the island's energy manager.",
  sparkyIntro2: "We have been infiltrated! Do you see those workers wandering around? Many of them aren't real elves.",
  sparkyIntro3: "They are Generative AI Agents in disguise. They look like us, but they are flooding our grid with bad data.",
  sparkyIntro4: "Technically speaking, Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that uses machine learning to create new content—including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data—instead of just analyzing existing data.",
  sparkyIntro5: "Let me explain simply. Generative AI is like a super-fast student.",
  sparkyIntro6: "It has read every book and seen every picture in the world. When you ask it to draw, write, or sing, it doesn't 'think' like you do.",
  sparkyIntro7: "It just guesses what comes next based on patterns. It's like a very clever parrot mimicking humans!",
  sparkyIntro8: "Yes! Please! I need you to find these AI impostors and remove them from the system.",
  sparkyIntro9: "Good question. Even though they are smart, they have big weaknesses. Listen carefully.",
  sparkyIntro10: "First is Hallucinations (The 'Daydreaming').",
  sparkyIntro11: "Sometimes, they get too confident and just make things up. They might draw hands with six fingers, or tell you facts that are total lies. If it looks or sounds impossible, it's a hallucination!",
  sparkyIntro12: "Perfect. Here is your mission:",
  sparkyIntro13: "Go talk to the workers on the islands. Ask them to show you their photos or writing.",
  sparkyIntro14: "If you spot mistakes or copies, mark them down. There are 9 spies hidden in total. Good luck, Agent!",
  sparkyIntro15: "Excellent! Your mission is now active. Good luck, Agent!",
